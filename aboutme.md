subtitle: A few words about me
---

I come from a supply chain background but spend most of my time now helping people and machines learn from data. R and Python are my weapons of choice.

I've worked on four continents, mostly at the intersection between training/knowledge management, IT and supply chain management in both the private and humanitarian sectors.

Languages are a source of endless fascination for me. I speak five of them fluently and learning Mandarin currently helps keep me busy.

I enjoy working as part of multidisciplinary teams.

I founded and help run the Hamburg R user group.
