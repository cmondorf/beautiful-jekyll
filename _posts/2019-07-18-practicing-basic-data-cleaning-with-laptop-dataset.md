title: Expanding on Dataquest's basic data cleaning mission
subtitle: Cleaning up a dataset on laptops
---

I've recently picked up Dataquest again and am as impressed with their content as I was when I first encountered it. I started
by reviewing the [basic data cleaning mission](https://www.dataquest.io/m/293-data-cleaning-basics/). 

At the end of the mission a few additional tasks and questions are suggested to continue practicing. I picked up the challenge and 
did them after redoing to cleaning examples in the courseware from memory on my own system (by downloading the dataset as 
opposed to simply coding in their online environment).

The practice was a great way to consolidate the lessons of the course, mainly related to munging with Pandas.

Another result of this exercise was to drive home that I should probably get around to migrating this blog to Pelican so I can
just use notebooks to create posts.

You can see my notebook [here](https://github.com/cmondorf/data_cleaning_basics/blob/master/cleaning_laptops_csv.ipynb).
